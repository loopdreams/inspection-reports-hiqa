\section{Context and Method}
\label{sec:org4230c98}
The data below was taken from the \href{https://www.hiqa.ie/reports-and-publications/inspection-reports}{HIQA Inspection Reports} for Disability Centres, available on their website in \texttt{.pdf} format.

Report URLs are listed under pages for \href{https://www.hiqa.ie/find-a-centre}{centres} where an inspection has occurred (\href{https://www.hiqa.ie/areas-we-work/find-a-centre/st-dominics-services}{example}). Using the HIQA register for disability centres, it was possible to get the URLs for the centre pages, and from these, the URLs for related inspection  reports.

Reports are written according to a standard template, making them relatively easy to parse. For the extraction, four main areas of the report were focused on:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{``Frontmatter''} area on the first page, including details of the centre id, date of inspection, type of inspection, etc.
\item \textbf{Number of residents present} at the time of inspection
\item Levels of \textbf{compliance} for the regulations inspected (``Compliant'', ``Not compliant'', ``Substantially compliant'')
\item The narrative text from the section titled ``\textbf{What residents told us and what inspectors observed}''
\end{itemize}

This is not an exhaustive list of information that could be extracted from the reports.

As part of this process 3,179 Inspection Reports were gathered/parsed. This compares with 3,312 that appear to be available on the HIQA website (as at 30\textsuperscript{th} December, 2023). In other words, the data covers about 96\% of the Inspection Reports for Disability Centres. In the case of the field ``Number of Residents Present'', there were 41 missing entries out of the 3,179 reports. Upon further inspection, the reason for this appears to be the introduction of a new type of report in 2023; ``Report of a Restrictive Practice Thematic Inspection''. See example \href{https://www.hiqa.ie/system/files?file=inspectionreports/5654-an-diadan-26-september-2023.pdf}{here}. These reports do not record number of residents present, nor compliance with the various regulations. Instead, there is an overall judgment based on the specific criteria of these reports. These specific judgements for thematic inspection reports were not captured here.

The dates of the reports range from \textbf{3\textsuperscript{rd} June 2020} - \textbf{18\textsuperscript{th} October 2023}.
\section{Number of Inspections}
\label{sec:orgeba7e1a}
Between 2020 and 2023, there were:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{3,179} inspection reports
\item \textbf{1,333} centres
\item \textbf{94} providers
\item \textbf{38,330} total checks for compliance
\end{itemize}

For the years 2021 and 2022, the average number of inspections per month was \textbf{86}.

\section{Number of Inspections per Centre}
\label{sec:org953ae41}
A significant majority (\textbf{78\%}) of centres received either 2 or 3 inspections over the period covered by the reports.

\section{Number of Residents Present}
\label{sec:org6f0886d}

The number of residents present at the time of inspection is highly contingent, so any clear line drawn between 'number of residents present' and actual 'occupancy' level of the centres is difficult. For example, there were 19 centres with '0' residents present at time of inspection. The HIQA register also lists \textbf{maximum occupancy} for a centre. Therefore, the true 'number of residents' would be somewhere between residents present for the inspection and maximum occupancy. To complicate things further, there were a number of centres which had \emph{more} residents present compared to the 'maximum occupancy' as listed in the HIQA register, for example, \href{https://www.hiqa.ie/areas-we-work/find-a-centre/grove-1}{see this centre and corresponding inspection report}.

Figures relating to 'number of residents present' were taken from the \emph{most recent} inspection report where there were multiple inspections per centre.
\begin{itemize}
\item The total number of residents present across the reports was \textbf{7,517}
\item The total maximum occupancy according to the HIQA register is \textbf{9,126}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Distribution - Residents Present and Maximum Occupancy}
\label{sec:org7dee06e}
The majority of centres had \textbf{4} residents present at time of inspection.

\begin{center}

\end{center}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{img/04_max_occupancy_dist.png}
\end{center}
\subsection{Average Residents Present by Area}
\label{sec:org9965c4f}

On average, \textbf{Cork} had the most residents present per centre.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{img/06_01_avg_res_per_centre.png}
\end{center}
\subsection{Congregated and Decongregated Settings}
\label{sec:orga62c0b8}

As part of the \href{https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/disability/congregatedsettings/timetomoveon.html\#:\~:text=Time\%20to\%20Move\%20on\%20from\%20Congregated\%20Settings\%20\%E2\%80\%93,people\%20to\%20\%E2\%80\%98live\%20ordinary\%20lives\%20in\%20ordinary\%20places\%E2\%80\%99.}{Time to Move on From Congregated Settings} policy, there is a commitment to moving people out from congregated settings where there are 10 or more people living together to ordinary homes where no more than 4 individuals live together. Using the ``number of residents'' present at an inspection and the HIQA registers' ``Maximum Occupancy'' information, it is possible to get a sense of the split between centres with \textbf{10+} people and centres with \textbf{less than 10 people}.

Based on ``number of residents present'', \textbf{70\%} of people lived centres with less than 10 people. Based on the HIQA register, \textbf{66\%} of the maximum occupancy is related to centres with less than 10.

This corresponds to \textbf{163} (\textbf{14\%}) congregated centres aligned to 'number of residents present', and \textbf{218} congregated centres (in terms of capacity) according to the HIQA registers' 'maximum occupancy'

\section{Compliance Levels}
\label{sec:orgd8c7dc8}
There are 32 regulations that can be checked as part of inspections. Not every inspection checks for compliance against all regulations. On average, \textbf{12} regulations were checked per inspection. Compliance is listed as either ``Compliant'', ``Substantially compliant'' or ``Not compliant''.

The following regulations relate to the area of \textbf{Capacity and Capability}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Regulation 3: Statement of purpose
\item Regulation 4: Written policies and procedures
\item Regulation 14: Person in charge
\item Regulation 15: Staffing
\item Regulation 16: Training and staff development
\item Regulation 19: Directory of residents
\item Regulation 21: Records
\item Regulation 22: Insurance
\item Regulation 23: Governance and management
\item Regulation 24: Admissions and contract for the provision of services
\item Regulation 30: Volunteers
\item Regulation 31: Notification of incidents
\item Regulation 32: Notifications of periods when person in charge is absent
\item Regulation 33: Notifications of procedures and arrangements for periods when person in charge is absent
\item Regulation 34: Complaints procedure
\end{itemize}

The following regulations relate to \textbf{Quality and Safety}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Regulation 5: Individualised assessment and personal plan
\item Regulation 6: Healthcare
\item Regulation 7: Positive behaviour support
\item Regulation 8: Protection
\item Regulation 9: Residents' rights
\item Regulation 10: Communication
\item Regulation 11: Visits
\item Regulation 12: Personal possessions
\item Regulation 13: General welfare and development
\item Regulation 17: Premises
\item Regulation 18: Food and nutrition
\item Regulation 20: Information for residents
\item Regulation 25: Temporary absence, transition and discharge of residents
\item Regulation 26: Risk management procedures
\item Regulation 27: Protections against infection
\item Regulation 28: Fire precautions
\item Regulation 29: Medicines and pharmaceutical services
\end{itemize}

The rate of non-compliant regulations stayed mostly stable at around 10-11\% per year.

As can be seen, \textbf{Nua Healthcare} stands out as a provider with both a high volume of inspections and a high level of compliance.
\section{Regulation 23: Governance and Management}
\label{sec:orgab3af12}

As Regulation 23: Governance and Management is both highly inspected and is approximately 20\% non compliant on average, it is worth looking more closely into it. From the HIQA documentation, the following elements contribute to this being marked as compliant/noncompliant:

Indicators of compliance include:

\begin{itemize}
\item the management structure is clearly defined and identifies the lines of authority and accountability, specifies roles and details responsibilities for all areas of service provision and includes arrangements for a person to manage the centre during absences of the person in charge, for example during annual leave or absence due to illness.
\item where there is more than one identified person participating in the management of the centre, the operational governance arrangement are clearly defined. Decisions are communicated, implemented and evaluated.
\item management systems are in place to ensure that the service provided is safe, appropriate to residents’ needs, consistent and effectively monitored
\item the person in charge demonstrates sufficient knowledge of the legislation and his/her statutory responsibilities and has complied with the regulations and or standards
\item there is an annual review of the quality and safety of care and support in the designated centre
\item a copy of the annual review is made available to residents
\item residents and their representatives are consulted with in the completion of the annual review of the quality and safety of care
\item the registered provider (or nominated person) visits the centre at least once every six months and produces a report on the safety and quality of care and support provided in the centre
\item arrangements are in place to ensure staff exercise their personal and professional responsibility for the quality and safety of the services that they are delivering
\item there are adequate resources to support residents achieving their individual personal plans
\item the facilities and services in the centre reflect the statement of purpose
\item practice is based on best practice and complies with legislative, regulatory and contractual requirements.
\end{itemize}

Indicators of non-compliance include:

\begin{itemize}
\item there are insufficient resources in the centre and the needs of residents are not met
\item there are sufficient resources but they are not appropriately managed to adequately meet residents’ needs
\item due to a lack of resources, the delivery of care and support is not in accordance with the statement of purpose
\item there is no defined management structure
\item governance and management systems are not known nor clearly defined
\item there are no clear lines of accountability for decision making and responsibility for the delivery of services to residents
\item staff are unaware of the relevant reporting mechanisms
\item there are no appropriate arrangements in place for periods when the person in charge is absence from the centre
\item the person in charge is absent from the centre but no suitable arrangements have been made for his or her absence
\item the person in charge is ineffective in his/her role and outcomes for residents are poor
\item the centre is managed by a suitably qualified person in charge; however, there are some gaps in his/her knowledge of their responsibilities under the regulations and this has resulted in some specific requirements not been met
\item the person in charge is inaccessible to residents and their families, and residents do not know who is in charge of the centre
\item an annual review of the quality and safety of care in the centre does not take place
\item an annual review of the quality and safety of care in the centre takes place but there is no evidence of learning from the review
\item a copy of the annual review is not made available to residents and or to the Chief Inspector
\item the registered provider (or nominated person) does not make an unannounced visit to the centre at least once every six months
\item the registered provider (or nominated person) does not produce a report on the safety and quality of care and support provided in the centre
\item effective arrangements are not in place to support, develop or manage all staff to exercise their responsibilities appropriately.

\section{Sentiment (Experimental)}
\label{sec:org7e318e0}

Aggregate 'sentiment' levels were obtained by passing the text contained under the section \textbf{\textbf{What residents told us and what inspectors observed}} to \texttt{GPT-3.5} for evaluation.

The following prompt was provided:

\begin{quote}
Summarize the following text into 5 keywords reflecting the sentiment of the residents. Do not include the word 'residents' as a keyword.

Also provide 3 key phrases reflecting the sentiment of the residents

Also assign an overall rating of 'positive', 'negative' or 'neutral' based on these sentiments.

Finally, summarise the text in two sentences.
\end{quote}

In other words, the following was asked for:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textbf{rating}} (positive/negative/neutral)
\item \textbf{\textbf{keywords}} (5)
\item \textbf{\textbf{key phrases}} (3)
\item \textbf{\textbf{summary}} (2 sentences)
\end{itemize}

There are a couple of major caveats here:

\begin{enumerate}
\item I used the least powerful version of GPT. The cost was around \$6.69 for 3,733 requests (this included some trail and error requests at the outset). The next most powerful api (\texttt{GPT-4}) would have cost around 30x this.
\item This was more of a 'proof of concept' exercise, more work would need to be done on the specfics of the GPT model, especially questions around how best to formulate the prompt. This exercise was primarily exploratory in nature, therefore a limited amount of time was spent engineering the prompt.
\end{enumerate}

The total word count across all the observation sections of the reports was approximately \textbf{2,550,376} words. The average word count for the observation sections of the reports was \textbf{802.26} words.
\subsection{Rating}
\label{sec:org4eddb74}

\textbf{86\%} of the inspections received a ``positive'' rating by the GPT model, based on the text containing observations of the inspections and what the residents said about the centre.

Across inspections in 2021, 2022, and 2023 (the years with most inspections), the percentage of ``negatively'' rated centres was around \textbf{10-11\%}.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{img/14_rating_pie.png}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{img/15_rating_year.png}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{img/16_rating_area.png}
\end{center}

These ratings also align with average levels of compliance. Centres with a ``positive'' rating were on average \textbf{73\%} fully compliant and \textbf{7\%} not compliant. Centres with a ``negative'' rating were on average \textbf{34\%} fully compliant and \textbf{43\%} not compliant. Therefore, accepting the limitations of this approach, you could conclude from these AI ratings that higher levels of compliance with the HIQA regulations leads to better user experience.

There is also a very tentative alignment between ``positive'' ratings and ``number of residents present''. As can be seen below, ``positive'' sentiment trends slightly downward in the case of more residents.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{img/17_rating_residents_pos.png}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{img/18_rating_res_neg.png}
\end{center}
\subsection{Keywords and Key Phrases}
\label{sec:org31a9aee}

The top 5 most frequent keywords for centres with a ``positive'' rating were \textbf{support}, \textbf{happy}, \textbf{comfortable}, \textbf{activities}, and \textbf{staff}. The top 5 keywords for centres with a ``negative'' rating were \textbf{infection prevention and control}, \textbf{compliance}, \textbf{improvements}, \textbf{staff}, and \textbf{support}. As can be seen, the word ``staff'' features prominently in both ``negative'' and ``positively'' rated centres, suggesting that staff are a key feature in shaping sentiment.

The top 10 most frequent key phrases that appeared were:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Good quality of life
\item Improvements were required
\item Residents were happy
\item Residents were supported
\item Residents appeared comfortable
\item Liked living in the centre
\item Residents felt safe
\item Unannounced Inspection
\item Warm interactions between residents and staff
\item Clean and tidy
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Word Clouds}
\label{sec:orgd3473dc}

Below is a word cloud for the keywords associated with \textbf{positively} rated centres:

There are also 33 columns relating to the regulations and one column containing the long text from the 'observations' section.

The columns \texttt{:report-id} and \texttt{:date} were manually added. \texttt{:report-id} was created as a unique identifier and combines the centre id followed by a hyphen ``-'' and the date of inspection in ``yyyyddmm'' format. In some cases inspections took place across two dates. In these cases the latter date was chosen for the \texttt{:date} and \texttt{:report-id} columns.
