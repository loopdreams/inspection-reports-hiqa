* Context and Method
The data below was taken from the [[https://www.hiqa.ie/reports-and-publications/inspection-reports][HIQA Inspection Reports]] for Disability Centres, available on their website in =.pdf= format.

Report URLs are listed under pages for [[https://www.hiqa.ie/find-a-centre][centres]] where an inspection has occurred ([[https://www.hiqa.ie/areas-we-work/find-a-centre/st-dominics-services][example]]). Using the HIQA register for disability centres, it was possible to get the URLs for the centre pages, and from these, the URLs for all inspection  reports.

Reports are written according to a **standard template**, making them relatively easy to parse. For the extraction, four main areas of the report were focused on:

- *"Frontmatter"* area on the first page, including details of the centre id, date of inspection, type of inspection, etc.
- *Number of residents present* at the time of inspection
- Levels of *compliance* for the regulations inspected ("Compliant", "Not compliant", "Substantially compliant")
- The narrative text from the section titled "*What residents told us and what inspectors observed*"

This is not an exhaustive list of information that could be extracted from the reports.

As part of this process 3,179 Inspection Reports were gathered/parsed. This compares with 3,312 that appear to be available on the HIQA website (as at 30th December, 2023). In other words, the data covers about 96% of the Inspection Reports for Disability Centres. In the case of the field "Number of Residents Present", there were 41 missing entries out of the 3,179 reports. This was not due to the values missing in the reports themselves, but due to the parsing method.

The dates of the reports range from *3^{rd} June 2020* - *18^{th} October 2023*.

* Number of Inspections
Between 2020 and 2023, there were:

- *3,179* inspection reports
- *1,333* centres
- *94* providers
- *38,330* total checks for compliance

For the years 2021 and 2022, the average number of inspections per month was *86*.

* Number of Inspections per Centre
A significant majority (*78%*) of centres received either 2 or 3 inspections over the period covered by the reports.

* Number of Residents Present

The number of residents present at the time of inspection is highly contingent, so any clear line drawn between 'number of residents present' and actual 'occupancy' level of the centres is difficult. For example, there were 19 centres with '0' residents present at time of inspection. The HIQA register also lists *maximum occupancy* for a centre. Therefore, the true 'number of residents' would be somewhere between residents present for the inspection and maximum occupancy. To complicate things further, there were a number of centres which had /more/ residents present compared to the 'maximum occupancy' as listed in the HIQA register, for example, [[https://www.hiqa.ie/areas-we-work/find-a-centre/grove-1][see this centre and corresponding inspection report]].

Figures relating to 'number of residents present' were taken from the /most recent/ inspection report where there were multiple inspections per centre.
- The total number of residents present across the reports was *7,515*
- The total maximum occupancy according to the HIQA register is *9,126*
** Distribution - Residents Present and Maximum Occupancy
The majority of centres had *4* residents present at time of inspection.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 10cm :float nil
[[file:img/04_max_occupancy_dist.png]]
** Congregated and Decongregated Settings
Based on 'number of residents present', *70%* of people lived in decongregated settings. Based on the HIQA register, *66%* of the maximum occupancy is related to decongregated settings.

This corresponds to *163* (*14%*) congregated centres and *1,169* decongregated centers aligned to 'number of residents present', and *218* congregated centres and *1,353* decongregated centres according to the HIQA register 'maximum occupancy'

* Compliance Levels
There are 32 regulations that can be checked as part of inspections. Not every inspection checks for compliance against all regulations. On average, *12* regulations were checked per inspection. Compliance is listed as either "Compliant", "Substantially compliant" or "Not compliant".

As can be seen, *Nua Healthcare* stands out as a provider with both a high level of service and a high level of compliance.

* Regulation 23: Governance and Management

As Regulation 23: Governance and Management is both highly inspected and is approximately 20% non compliant on average, it is worth looking more closely into it. From the HIQA documentation, the following elements contribute to this being marked as compliant/noncompliant:

Indicators of compliance include:

- the management structure is clearly defined and identifies the lines of authority and accountability, specifies roles and details responsibilities for all areas of service provision and includes arrangements for a person to manage the centre during absences of the person in charge, for example during annual leave or absence due to illness.
- where there is more than one identified person participating in the management of the centre, the operational governance arrangement are clearly defined. Decisions are communicated, implemented and evaluated.
- management systems are in place to ensure that the service provided is safe, appropriate to residents’ needs, consistent and effectively monitored
- the person in charge demonstrates sufficient knowledge of the legislation and his/her statutory responsibilities and has complied with the regulations and or standards
- there is an annual review of the quality and safety of care and support in the designated centre
- a copy of the annual review is made available to residents
- residents and their representatives are consulted with in the completion of the annual review of the quality and safety of care
- the registered provider (or nominated person) visits the centre at least once every six months and produces a report on the safety and quality of care and support provided in the centre
- arrangements are in place to ensure staff exercise their personal and professional responsibility for the quality and safety of the services that they are delivering
- there are adequate resources to support residents achieving their individual personal plans
- the facilities and services in the centre reflect the statement of purpose
- practice is based on best practice and complies with legislative, regulatory and contractual requirements.

Indicators of non-compliance include:

- there are insufficient resources in the centre and the needs of residents are not met
- there are sufficient resources but they are not appropriately managed to adequately meet residents’ needs
- due to a lack of resources, the delivery of care and support is not in accordance with the statement of purpose
- there is no defined management structure
- governance and management systems are not known nor clearly defined

* Sentiment (Experimental)

Aggregate 'sentiment' levels were obtained by passing the text contained under the section **What residents told us and what inspectors observed** to =GPT-3.5= for evaluation.

The following prompt was provided:

#+begin_quote
Summarize the following text into 5 keywords reflecting the sentiment of the residents. Do not include the word 'residents' as a keyword.

Also provide 3 key phrases reflecting the sentiment of the residents

Also assign an overall rating of 'positive', 'negative' or 'neutral' based on these sentiments.

Finally, summarise the text in two sentences.
#+end_quote

In other words, the following was asked for:

- **rating** (positive/negative/neutral)
- **keywords** (5)
- **key phrases** (3)
- **summary** (2 sentences)

There are a couple of major caveats here:

1. I used the least powerful version of GPT. The cost was around $6.69 for 3,733 requests (this included some trail and error requests at the outset). The next most powerful api (=GPT-4=) would have cost around 30x this.
2. I am not very familiar with the GPT model, especially questions around how best to formulate the prompt. This exercise was primarily exploratory in nature, therefore a limited amount of time was spent engineering the prompt.

The total word count across all the observation sections of the reports was approximately *2,550,376* word. The average word count for the observation sections of the reports was *802.26* words.

** Rating

*86%* of the inspections received a "positive" rating by the GPT model, based on the text containing observations of the inspections and what the residents said about the centre.

Across inspections in 2021, 2022, and 2023 (the years with most inspections), the percentage of "negatively" rated centres was around *10-11%*.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 12cm
[[file:img/15_rating_year.png]]

[[file:img/16_rating_area.png]]

These ratings also align with average levels of compliance. Centres with a "positive" rating were on average *73%* fully compliant and *7%* not compliant. Centres with a "negative" rating were on average *34%* fully compliant and *43%* not compliant. Therefore, accepting the limitations of this approach, you could conclude from these ratings, based on AI analysis of user feedback, that higher levels of compliance with the HIQA regulations leads to better user experience.

There is also a very tentative alignment between "positive" ratings and "number of residents present". As can be seen below, "positive" sentiment trends slightly downward in the case of more residents.

[[file:img/17_rating_residents_pos.png]]

[[file:img/18_rating_res_neg.png]]

** Keywords and Key Phrases

The top 5 most frequent keywords for centres with a "positive" rating were *support*, *happy*, *comfortable*, *activities*, and *staff*. The top 5 keywords for centres with a "negative" rating were *infection prevention and control*, *compliance*, *improvements*, *staff*, and *support*. As can be seen, the word "staff" features prominently in both "negative" and "positively" rated centres, suggesting that staff are a key feature in shaping sentiment.

The top 10 most frequent key phrases that appeared were:

1. Good quality of life
2. Improvements were required
3. Residents were happy
4. Residents were supported
5. Residents appeared comfortable
6. Liked living in the centre
7. Residents felt safe
8. Unannounced Inspection
9. Warm interactions between residents and staff
10. Clean and tidy
