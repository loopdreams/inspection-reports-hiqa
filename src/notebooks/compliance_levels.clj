;; ## Regulations by Provider and Area
;;
;; I will look more closely below at two of the areas with a higher proportion of "Not compliant"
;; judgements, **Governance and Mannagement** and **Fire Precautions**.
;;

;; ### Regulation 23: Governance and Management
;;
;; Indicators of compliance include:
;; - the management structure is clearly defined and identifies the lines of authority and
;; accountability, specifies roles and details responsibilities for all areas of service
;; provision and includes arrangements for a person to manage the centre during
;; absences of the person in charge, for example during annual leave or absence due to
;; illness.
;; - where there is more than one identified person participating in the management of the
;; centre, the operational governance arrangement are clearly defined. Decisions are
;; communicated, implemented and evaluated.
;; - management systems are in place to ensure that the service provided is safe,
;; appropriate to residentsâ€™ needs, consistent and effectively monitored
;; - the person in charge demonstrates sufficient knowledge of the legislation and his/her
;; statutory responsibilities and has complied with the regulations and or standards
;; - there is an annual review of the quality and safety of care and support in the
;; designated centre
;; - a copy of the annual review is made available to residents
;; - residents and their representatives are consulted with in the completion of the annual
;; review of the quality and safety of care
;; - the registered provider (or nominated person) visits the centre at least once every six
;; months and produces a report on the safety and quality of care and support provided in
;; the centre
;; - arrangements are in place to ensure staff exercise their personal and professional
;; responsibility for the quality and safety of the services that they are delivering
;; - there are adequate resources to support residents achieving their individual personal
;; plans
;; - the facilities and services in the centre reflect the statement of purpose
;; - practice is based on best practice and complies with legislative, regulatory and
;; contractual requirements.
;;
;;Indicators of non-compliance include:
;; - there are insufficient resources in the centre and the needs of residents are not met
;; - there are sufficient resources but they are not appropriately managed to adequately
;; meet residentsâ€™ needs
;; - due to a lack of resources, the delivery of care and support is not in accordance with
;; the statement of purpose
;; - there is no defined management structure
;; - governance and management systems are not known nor clearly defined
;; - there are no clear lines of accountability for decision making and responsibility for the
;; delivery of services to residents
;; - staff are unaware of the relevant reporting mechanisms
;; - there are no appropriate arrangements in place for periods when the person in charge
;; is absence from the centre
;; - the person in charge is absent from the centre but no suitable arrangements have been
;; made for his or her absence
;; - the person in charge is ineffective in his/her role and outcomes for residents are poor
;; - the centre is managed by a suitably qualified person in charge; however, there are
;; some gaps in his/her knowledge of their responsibilities under the regulations and this
;; has resulted in some specific requirements not been met
;; - the person in charge is inaccessible to residents and their families, and residents do not
;; know who is in charge of the centre
;; - an annual review of the quality and safety of care in the centre does not take place
;; - an annual review of the quality and safety of care in the centre takes place but there is
;; no evidence of learning from the review
;; - a copy of the annual review is not made available to residents and or to the Chief
;; Inspector
;; - the registered provider (or nominated person) does not make an unannounced visit to
;; the centre at least once every six months
;; - the registered provider (or nominated person) does not produce a report on the safety
;; and quality of care and support provided in the centre
;; - effective arrangements are not in place to support, develop or manage all staff to
;; exercise their responsibilities appropriately.

;; ### Regulation 28: Fire Precautions
;;
;;Indicators of compliance include:
;; - suitable fire equipment is provided and serviced when required, for example, the fire
;; alarm is serviced on a quarterly basis and fire-fighting equipment is serviced on an
;; annual basis
;; - there is adequate means of escape, including emergency lighting. For example,
;; escape routes are clear from obstruction and sufficiently wide to enable evacuation,
;; taking account of residentsâ€™ needs and evacuation methods likely to be employed
;; - there is a procedure for the safe evacuation of residents and staff in the event of fire
;; prominently displayed and or readily available, as appropriate
;; - the mobility and cognitive understanding of residents has been adequately accounted
;; for in the evacuation procedure
;; - residents are involved in fire drills whenever possible
;; - staff are trained annually or more frequently if required
;; - staff know what to do in the event of a fire
;; - there are fire drills at suitable intervals, usually twice yearly or more often if required
;; - fire records are kept which include details of fire drills, fire alarm tests, fire-fighting
;; equipment, regular checks of escape routes, exits and fire doors
;; - appropriate maintenance of laundry equipment and proper ventilation of dryers
;; - appropriate storage of equipment such as medical gases and combustible material.
;;
;;Indicators of non-compliance include:
;; - the evacuation procedure for the centre is not fit for purpose, for example, the
;; procedure includes residents remaining in their bedroom to await rescue by the fire
;; service
;; - the mobility and cognitive understanding of residents has not been considered in the
;; fire and evacuation procedure
;; - residents do not know what to do in the event of a fire taking into account their
;; abilities
;; - escape routes are obstructed or not suitable for the residents, staff and visitors
;; expected to use them
;; - there are no records of regular fire drills, fire alarm tests or maintenance of equipment
;; - fire safety equipment has not been serviced in the previous 12 months
;; - some fire doors are wedged open
;; - the building is not adequately subdivided with fire resistant construction such as fire
;; doors as appropriate
;; - poor housekeeping and or inappropriate storage or use of medical gases and
;; combustible materials, represents an unnecessary risk of fire in the centre
;; - an adequate fire alarm has not been provided
;; - an adequate emergency lighting system has not been provided
;; - staff do not know what to do in the event of a fire
;; - staff are not trained in fire safety and or, if required for evacuation, resident-handling
;; - fire evacuation procedures are not prominently displayed throughout the building, as
;; appropriate.
